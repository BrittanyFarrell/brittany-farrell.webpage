          <h3>About Brittany</h3>

          <p>I’m currently enrolled in Thinkful’s Engineering Immersion Program and working towards my goal of becoming a full stack engineer. I'm in love with the satisfaction that comes with watching my code work the way it was intended to and I look forward to joining a capable team someday.</p>
            
          <p>When I was younger, I spent a fair amount of time coding simple VNGs on Ren'py. Other things I enjoy include:</p>
          <!--below is the code for a list-->
          <ol><!--the <ol> tag indicates this is an ordered list-->
            <li>Ceramic Art</li><!--the <li> and </li> tags encapulate an item on the list. each item is individually wrapped by these tags.-->
            <li>Crochet</li>
            <li>Spoken Word Poetry</li>
            <li>Christian Hip Hop</li>
          </ol> <!--the list must be closed for the code to run properly-->

          <p>If you're looking for a new developer to help with a project or join your staff, then feel free to contact me. I'm excited to see all the things I will create with my future coworkers.</p>
