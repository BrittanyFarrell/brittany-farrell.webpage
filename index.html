          <h3>About Brittany</h3>

          <p>I’m currently enrolled in Thinkful’s Engineering Immersion Program and working towards my goal of becoming a full stack engineer. When I was younger, I spent a fair amount of time coding simple VNGs on Ren'py. As a writer, I enjoyed piecing together their multi-ending plot lines- their intricacy only limited by my patience and imagination.</p>

          <p>Other things I enjoy include:</p>
          <!----below is the code for a list------>
          <ol><!-----the <ol> tag indicates this is an ordered list----->
            <li>Ceramic Art</li><!-----the <li> and </li> tags encapulate an item on the list. each item is individually wrapped by these tags.----->
            <li>Crochet</li>
            <li>Spoken Word Poetry</li>
            <li>Christian Hip Hop</li>
          </ol> <!----the list must be closed for the code to run properly------>

          <p>I’ve always enjoyed creative forms of expression. Today, I love listening to Christian Hip Hop and poetry as well as working with my hands.</p>
